        <div class="div1"><p>A future project that I plan on doing for an instagram artist. Im going to try different things that push me out of my comfort zone in design and pull through with creativity. The artist is @big_squid_man if you want to check them out!</p><img src="https://artdm173.joshuaworkman.com/project3/images/site-ideas.jpg"></div>
        <div class="div2"><p>A project I've done for an english class. The piece is about Ophilia's death in the drama Hamlet. I always wanted to try more abstract art, so I took the chance in this project.</p><img src="https://artdm173.joshuaworkman.com/project3/images/Ophilia.jpg"></div>
        <div class="div3"><p>A piece that was done very quickly but came out better than I expected. I used different filters on instagram and combined them into one piece to create a more retro portrait.</p><img src="https://artdm173.joshuaworkman.com/project3/images/IMG_13392.jpeg"></div>
        <div class="div4"><p>I always loved photography and want to get better at it as I progress in design. You need good pictures to showcase on a good site! This stop was on a hill at Crater Lake, I definitely recommend going if you can! </p><img src="https://artdm173.joshuaworkman.com/project3/images/IMG_2676.jpeg"></div>
        <div class="div5"><p>One of my favorite pieces. If you have ever watched the show Cowboy Bebop you should recognize Spike in arguably one of the most iconic scenes in the show. If you look close you can see the burned parts of the stars make his facial features and hair line! </p><img src="https://artdm173.joshuaworkman.com/project3/images/IMG_1783.JPG"></div>
        <div class="div6"><p>I've made several of these little vectors of various video-game characters. Cloud from Final Fantasy is probably the best of the bunch though with him expressing the most detail in clothing and colors.</p><img src="https://artdm173.joshuaworkman.com/project3/images/IMG_1638.PNG"></div>

                <h3>Grid</h3>
                <p>One of the first projects that ive done for this class and list of artists that I intend to work with in the future. I would like to make make pages for each and everyone of these artists but I had to start somewhere.</p>

                <p>Probably my favorite page that ive done in this class. I loved doing the animations in css and intend to use alot more animations in all the pages I plan to make in the future!</p>

                <h3>The Prototype</h3>
                <p> An old page we worked on for testing our knowledge in design early on in the course. This page is ultimately the upgraded version that I myself built with html and css instead of a program.</p>
